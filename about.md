# <cg>BetterSave Recovery</c>

This mod recovers levels and lists lost by <cy>BetterSave</c>. It will do this automatically on startup. The recovery will skip duplicate levels and lists, determined by level data, so exact copiables may not be recovered. Note that if you have made tiny changes to a lot of levels, they may not be detected as duplicates, and as such may result in duplicates being added.

For safety, <cp>the recovery will <cy>not</c> delete the save directory</c>. If you are sure everything has been recovered and want to free up space, you can manually delete the `levels` folder from your GD save directory.

## <cr>This is NOT BetterSave!</c>

This mod <co>only recovers lost data</c>. It does not provide any of the other features of BetterSave, like the trashcan or saving speed improvements. The trashcan has been [moved to its own mod](mod:hjfod.trashcan), and saving speed improvements will be included in [BetterEdit](mod:hjfod.betteredit).
